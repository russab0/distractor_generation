But do you know about \"\" junk sleep \"\" ? Recently , a British survey found that electronic   products in teenagers bedrooms are affecting their sleep . The survey was done among 1,000 British kids from 12 to 16 . It found that thirty percent of them got just 4 to 7 hours sleep every day . But doctors say they need 8 to 9 hours . Almost a quarter of the kids said they fell asleep more than once a week while watching TV , listening to music or using other electronic products . \"\" This is very worrying . \"\" Said Dr Chris Idzikowski , a British expert , \"\" We call it \\' junk sleep \\' , It means you do n\\'t get enough sleep and the quality of the sleep is bad , too . If you do n\\'t get good rest , you do n\\'t perform well in school the next day . \"\" The survey found that 40 percent of the kids felt tired each day , with girls between 13 and 16 feeling the worst .

It offered a packet of 100 mixed stamps for $ 10 . Trudy wanted to start a stamp collection so she ordered the packet . One hundred mixed stamps seemed a good way to begin a collection . She sent a postal order to the stamp company with her order , and waited excitedly for the stamps arrived . Trudy checked the mail every day for four weeks but the stamps did n\\'t arrive . So Trudy decided to write to the company . \"\" Dear Sir / Madam , \"\" she wrote , \"\" a month ago I sent you a postal order for $ 10 as payment for 100 mixed stamps . They have n\\'t arrived . Please send them by return of mail . \"\" another month passed . The stamps still did n\\'t arrive and she did n\\'t receive any replay to her letter . She asked her father for advice . Her father said , \"\" You must write a stronger letter . Make the stamp company worry that you will report them to the authorities . \"\" \"\" Dear Sir / Madam , \"\" she wrote in her second letter . \"\" I am writing to complain about your poor service .

Yet , the most frightening thing of all about the night is that twice as many children are killed while out and about on Halloween compared to any other day of the year , according to a study by Safe Kids Worldwide . It can also be a worrying time for others , especially elderly people living alone . But many people think it \\'s just harmless fun . But is it harmless fun ? Police forces across Britain are giving warnings about Halloween night . They are asking all those wishing to celebrate Halloween this year to respect those who do n\\'t want to join in . Some forces , like West Mercia Police , have produced \"\" Sorry , No Trick or Treat\"\"posters which can be downloaded from their website , and put up in windows . They want people to send them to the old or anyone who may be frightened by ghosts   knocking on their doors . A spokesman said : \"\" Children should not call on houses where the posters are put up , neither should they call on strangers , as this can put young people at risk and also make some house owners anxious , especially those who are elderly or living alone . \"\" The police want all trick or treaters to remember that disturbing other people or throwing objects at their homes or cars are all criminal offences . \"\" What may start off as a bit of fun could end up with someone getting a criminal record , \"\" they warn . \"\" Parents may want to consider having a Halloween party at home , instead . \"\" Kent Police are warning young people never to go into the home of someone they do n\\'t know -- and to remember not to frighten people . Warwickshire Police are also warning that tricks may seem like harmless fun but can cause trouble to others .

Today , at twenty - seven , I have come to rediscover them in ways that my teenage mind would not allow -- as adults and as friends with their own faults and weaknesses . One night after my move back home , I overheard my father on the telephone . There was some trouble . Later , Dad shared the problem with me . Apparently my legal training had earned me some privileges in his eyes . I talked through the problem with Dad , analyzing the purposes of the people involved and offering several negotiation strategies .He listened patiently before finally admitting , \"\" I ca n\\'t think like that . I am a simple man . \"\" Dad is a brilliant scientist who can deconstruct the building blocks of nature . Yet human nature is a mystery to him .

And so , there it was -- it was no one \\'s fault that my father held no interest in human lives while I placed great importance in them . We are at times born more sensitive , wide - eyed , and dreamy than our parents and become more curious and idealistic than them . Dad perhaps never expected me for a child . And I , who knew Dad as an intelligent man , had never understood that his intelligence did not cover all of my feelings . It has saved me years of questioning and confusion .

One video shows farmers how to make a natural insecticide from neem seeds to prevent insect damage to crops . The process starts with sorting and drying the neem fruits . Then let the fruit dry in the sun for about three or four days , until they become brown . Using a mortar   and stick , the fruits are slightly _ to remove the shells from the fruits without breaking the seed inside . The videos use computer animation .

Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors , I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without \" outside help \" . \" What kind of help is that ? \" I asked , expecting them to tell me that they would need a    or family friend to help them out . \" Surgery , \" one replied . I was pretty alarmed by that response . It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job . One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height . \" They break your legs , put in special extending screws , and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re - grows , you can get at least 5 cm taller ! \" At that point , I was shocked . I am short , I ca n't deny that , but I do n't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller . I do n't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles , as I 'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall ! It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting \" perfection \" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality . No one is born perfect , yet magazines , TV shows and movies present images of thin , tall , beautiful people as being the norm . Advertisements for slimming aids , beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers , further creating an idea that \" perfection \" is a requirement , and that it must be purchased , no matter what the cost . In my opinion , skills , rather than appearance , should determine how successful a person is in his / her chosen career . [questionstart] Which ' s the best title for the passage ? .
